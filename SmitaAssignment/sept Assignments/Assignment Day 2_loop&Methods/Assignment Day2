1> create a class BankAccount
//member variables or instance variables
	int id;
	double curBal;
	String name;
//member method
public void deposit(double amount)
public void withdraw(double amount)
//main method
create 2 Object of BankAccount class and
invoke both the methods

2> write TestMyMethod class
with a main method
to display a menu with the help of switch case
   1> max(int n1, int n2)- to find out maximum of 2 numbers
	2> min(int n1, int n2)- to find out minimum of 2 numbers
	3> oddEven(int n1, int n2)- to find out odd and even of 2 numbers
	4> prime(int n1)- to check wether the given number is prime or not
	5> factprial(int n1)- to find factors of the given number
	6> maxMin(int n1, int n2,int n3)- to find out maximum 
		and minimun of 3 numbers 
		
ask the user wether he wants to continue or not(yes/no)
do while loop will continue till the user enter yes.

3> Pyramid * Pattern with the help of nested for loop
4> create a static method to add OddAndEvenNumbers in an 
array with the enhanced for loop
5>Print 1 to 100 except multiples of 5 (use continue)
6>Write a program to print right angle * pattern
